## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Olivia

I build high-performance web applications and scalable infrastructure that drive real business outcomes. With over 4 years in full-stack engineering, I specialize in creating efficient solutions using AWS, Node.js/TypeScript, React, Docker, and SQL/NoSQL databases.

Passionate about the open-source community, I co-created CacheMunk, a Node.js caching library that boosted throughput 8â€“10x, reduced latency by 90%, and improved JSON compression by 75%. I also enjoy presenting technical talks, such as "Decoupling Systems for Scalability" and workshops on AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

I love connecting with fellow engineersâ€”feel free to reach out about distributed systems, infrastructure, or collaboration opportunities!
