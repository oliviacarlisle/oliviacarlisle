## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Olivia

NYC-based Software Engineer building scalable systems that handle real-world demands.

ðŸš€ Co-creator of CacheMunk, an open-source Redis-compatible caching library that delivers 8-10x throughput gains  
ðŸ’» Full-stack expertise: AWS, AI/ML, TypeScript/Node.js, Python React, Docker, distributed systems  
ðŸŽ¯ Shipping production code that scales  

I believe great engineering is about elegant solutions to hard problems. When I'm not writing code, you'll find me teaching AWS CDK workshops or speaking about event-driven architectures.

Always down to chat about distributed systems, infrastructure, or interesting engineering challenges. Let's build something cool together!
